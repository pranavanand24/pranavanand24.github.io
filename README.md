Hi there👋 , I am a budding software developer and aspiring AI researcher. I'm a passionate learner who's always willing to learn and apply technologies across various domains. I love to explore new technologies and leverage them to solve real-life problems.

📌 I mainly work with Python, C# and its libraries & frameworks, machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing.

✍️ I’m working on reading and understanding research papers.

🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on artificial intelligence research projects.


**Education**

🏫 Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering '22 - Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, Patiala, India.


**Experience**

**Machine Learning Engineer Intern at WiJungle, Gurugram (WFH) [Jan 2022 - Jun 2022]**
  
• Worked on designing, developing, and researching ML-based systems, models, and schemes.

• Searching and selecting appropriate data sets before data collection, web scraping, and data modeling.

• Visualizing data for deeper insights, training, and retraining systems and models as needed.

• Analyzing the use cases of various algorithms and ranking them by their accuracy and success
probability.

• Learning and working on various existing frameworks, and libraries, and reading research papers.

• Running tests, performing statistical analysis and interpreting test results.

**Research Intern at Tel Aviv University [Nov 2020 - Feb 2021]**
  
• Worked under Dr. Parteek Bhatia in LAMBDA Labs on a computer vision, i.e. making a model for detecting plant infestation using the holes on the leaves as Region of Interests and classifying the infestation in 0, 0-25, 0-50, 50-75, 75-100 percent intervals on real field Crop Images with approaches like Semantic Segmentation, Edge detection, and many other computer vision techniques and deep learning architecture.

• Final Result - faced problems with low usable data, high bias in labels, and less preprocessing of images due to Image compressing of mostly single color “green” and no clear separation boundary due to too many leaves in a single image. we couldn’t come up with some novel result but came up with guidelines for the next batch of data and image collection which could produce an optimum result.
