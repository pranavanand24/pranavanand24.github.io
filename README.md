‚Ä¢ Conducted rigorous testing, employing statistical analyses to interpret test results, ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of ML-based systems. This commitment to empirical validation underpinned the continuous enhancement of models and systems.

**üè≠ Research Intern at Tel Aviv University [Nov 2020 - Feb 2021]**
  
‚Ä¢ Worked under Dr. Parteek Bhatia in LAMBDA Labs on a computer vision, i.e. Worked on Developing a robust model for the identification of plant infestations involving leveraging the distinctive features presented by the holes on leaves as Region of Interest (ROI). This endeavor entails a comprehensive exploration of cutting-edge computer vision techniques, including but not limited to Semantic Segmentation and Edge Detection. By strategically employing deep learning architectures, the objective is to not only detect the presence of infestations but also to classify them based on severity, categorizing the affected areas into intervals such as 0%, 0-25%, 25-50%, 50-75%, and 75-100%. The real-world application of this model involves the analysis of crop images captured in field conditions, presenting a dynamic and challenging environment for accurate detection and classification. Through the integration of diverse computational methodologies, the aim is to enhance the precision and reliability of plant infestation detection, thereby contributing to more effective crop management strategies in agriculture.

‚Ä¢ Final Result - Encountering challenges characterized by limited usable data, pronounced bias in labeling, and inadequate preprocessing of images‚Äîlargely attributed to the compression of predominantly single-colored "green" images‚Äîour efforts were impeded by the absence of clear separation boundaries, compounded by the abundance of leaves in a single image. While groundbreaking results remained elusive, our endeavors yielded valuable insights. We have synthesized comprehensive guidelines for the subsequent data and image collection phase, aiming to rectify these limitations and pave the way for optimal outcomes in future analyses.
